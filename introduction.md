### Introduction

Colloquy is a framework-agnostic package for managing persistent conversation contexts written in PHP.

#### What is a conversation context?

Conversation context is data provided by user, stored between requests of multi-step form on your website.

#### The benefits

Thanks to Colloquy you can easily persist and retrieve contexts so that user won't have to fill in steps of the form
that he already did in the past. Furthermore, you can define which data, how long and where this context should be stored.
